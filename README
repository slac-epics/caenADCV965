To build this module you must first create a RELEASE_SITE
file. The RELEASE_SITE file should define the path to the
top of your EPICS tree at your site.

Example file looks like so:
===============================================================

#RELEASE Location of external products
# Run "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the application
# top directory each time this file is changed.

# =============================================================
# Define the top of the EPICS tree for your site.
# We will build some tools/scripts that allow us to
# change this easily when relocating software.
# ==============================================================
EPICS_SITE_TOP=/usr/local/lcls/epics

================================================================

The Caen ADC driver was modified:
    (1) To work with both 8-ch and 16-ch boards
	(2) 'old' and 'new' models
	(3) Several bug fixes from Spear (S.Allison) have been included in this release.
	
The driver is 'backward-compatible' - i.e., nothing needs to be done for a 16-ch board.
Call a different config function from st.cmd for 8-ch board

Example st.cmd that has one 16-ch board and one 8-ch board

# 16-channel board - same as before
caenV965Config( 0, 0x00A00000, 24, 90, 3, 0)

# 8-channel board - add "_8" to caenV965Config
caenV965Config_8( 1, 0x00C00000, 24, 91, 3, 0)
